### Context:

This is week six of Mod 1 and I spent about 30 hours on this project. While I would have liked to have gotten it done sooner, I spent a lot of time researching a few new methods.

### Learning Goals:

Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

For this project I used VS CODE and dev tools. 

### Wins + Challenges:

Challenge 1:
    Spent too long on Friday researching methods and over thinking. Then pseudocoded into my main and wrote the majority of my code in main and had to refactor everything today
Challenge 2:
    Really struggled with my win checking function today spent a long time working on the checker and then the dev tools showed I was finally accounting for a win. When I started trying to manipulate the DOM my current player turn count was off so my wins stopped calculating on the click it happens on. Now it's the next click. I am so confused, I used the same logic on my draw logic and that all worked including my timeout....
Challenge 3: 
    Did not get to reset button, had functiosn started, and it was clearing my player board positions, but I didn't get the DOM to change, deleted the button 

Win 1: Proud of my CSS and HTML. I feel like I am able to get those started quickly. I tried to use something other than divs but my elements were not lining up so I had to switch to all divs. 
Win 2: After how stressed I was this morning I am pretty proud of the point I got my java to in one day. If I had another hour or two, I feel like I could have locked it in
